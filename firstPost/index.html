        <p>For our first post, we want to share our most recent hike with you. :)

        On Friday, September 4th, we woke up at 5:30am to conquer this beautiful hike. We were rewarded with a clear day that gave us a panorama view of the North Shore. We also used Strava for the first time to track our hike.
        
        Stats (from Strava): 
        
        Distance - 15.5km 
        
        Elevation Gain - 1576m
        Time - 5 h 4 m 

        
        We recognize our privilege of living in such a beautiful province and being able to explore on a Friday. As former teachers, we believe in supporting all children to receive an education. We hope to continue to use our time to advocate for girls in Nepal and around the world to have equal opportunities.
